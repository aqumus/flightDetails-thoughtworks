#### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Whats Working

- Flight details Form
- Showing responsive Flight list
- Flight Searching Algorithm (including brownie points) :-)

### Few Assumption made

- Use case is only for domestic flights (timezone variations not considered in searching algorithm)
- Maximum layover considered is of 2days

### Needs work

- Responsiveness is not fully achieve, have few glitches
- Test cases not covered
- Would be good to run search algorithm in web worker
